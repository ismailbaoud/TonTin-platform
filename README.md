# 📘 TonTin - Rotation Management Platform

[TontTin specifications](https://1drv.ms/w/c/f4fee283c02594e2/IQAcW0ZWdf7_QLAgHjDEWnOxAVboQS-zoPOA4mpw47VxErU?e=xCDVtN)

## 📝 Overview

TonTin is a full-stack web platform designed to manage **rotation-based group systems** inspired by the Moroccan concept of *Dâr*, without focusing on savings or money handling.

The platform helps groups organize members, manage turns, coordinate cycles, and communicate transparently — **no financial transactions are processed or tracked**.

TonTin focuses on organization, fairness, and visibility, making it suitable for community groups, associations, cooperatives, or any structured rotation-based collaboration.
